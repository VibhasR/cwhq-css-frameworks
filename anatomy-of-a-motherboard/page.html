<!--
Homework 1: Complete this anatomy by adding the popover for every image.

In this file,
- In the remaining button tags, set the data-bs-toggle attribute to popover.
- Set the title attribute to the title of popover.
- Set the data-bs-content attribute to the content of popover.
- Go through the documentation to customize the popover as you like.
